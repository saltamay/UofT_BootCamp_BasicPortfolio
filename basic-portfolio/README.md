## Basic Portfolio

This is a basic portfolio page design that has "Home",  "Portfolio", and "Contact" pages that is aimed to showcase portfolio projects I am working on as well as my contact information.

### Description

In this project, I wanted to showcase my newly acquired as a front-end web developer. With this  portfolio, I am taking my first step toward building my personal brand.

### Build with:

HTML5 and CSS3

### Features

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `Basic-Portfolio`.
2. Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.
3. Navigate to the `Basic-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:
    - 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
    - A folder called `assets`.
    - Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
        - In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
        - In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).
4. Push the above changes to GitHub.
    - Make sure to `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial site files"`. Then type `git push origin master` to push your changes to your GitHub repo.
5. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:
    - If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
    - If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
    - So on and so forth.
6. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.
    - Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
    - The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
    - Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.
7. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.
    - Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
    - Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.
8. Push your changes to Github.
